title: "The Pre-Flight Check for Autonomous AI: Zero-Model Structural Reasoning Validation at Scale"
abstract: "The Trignum framework introduces a fundamental reimagining of artificial intelligence architecture. Instead of brute-force linear processing through 'hot' silicon, we propose Magnetic Trillage—a tri-polar geometric separation of data into Logic, Illogic, and Human Context. The framework introduces the Subtractive Filter, T-CHIP (Tensor Character), and the Cold State Hardware Hypothesis. It implements a zero-model structural reasoning validator that achieves 82,544 samples/second throughput."
