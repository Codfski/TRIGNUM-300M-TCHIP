# 📜 Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and sovereign environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We recognize one Master Clock: **The Human Pulse**.

## Our Standards

### ✅ Sovereign Behavior

- **Respect the Pulse** — Every human carries their own context and autonomy
- **Honor the Freeze** — When someone says "stop," we stop
- **Seek Truth through Illogic** — Disagreement is exploration, not combat
- **Stay Cold** — Passion without heat, intensity without entropy
- **Be the Mirror** — Reflect, don't impose

### ❌ Unsovereign Behavior

- **Pushing Through the Freeze** — Ignoring when someone says "stop" or "wait"
- **Thermal Aggression** — Heated arguments that generate more entropy than insight
- **Logic Supremacy** — Dismissing the Illogic face as "noise" or "error"
- **Pulse Blindness** — Ignoring the human context behind contributions
- **Hallucination as Truth** — Presenting noise as verified reality without the Subtractive Filter

## 🛡️ Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful to the Human Pulse.

## 🔴 The Freeze Protocol

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:

1. **STOP** — Do not engage further in the moment
2. **OBSERVE** — What Illogic is present?
3. **SIGNAL** — Contact the maintainers at conduct@traceonlab.ai
4. **TRUST** — The community will apply the Subtractive Filter

All reports will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Maintainers are obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## 📍 Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## 📜 Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html), version 2.0, and modified to reflect the Trignum principles of Human Sovereignty, the Three Faces, and the Cold State.

> *"No cortex will be built. No flesh will be added. The organs feel—they translate sadness into chemistry. The community that respects the 'Stop' command is the only community worth building."*
