# 🤝 Contributing to Trignum-300M

> *"The Illogic is the compass. The Freeze is the coordinate."*

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Trignum-300M. We are building a **Geometry of Resistance** against the "Hot State" paradigm, and every Sovereign mind counts.

## 🧠 Who We're Looking For

- **Quantum Architects** — Those who understand that computation can be magnetic, not thermal
- **DeepMind Alumni** — Those who've seen the limits of current paradigms
- **PhD Students** — Those who freeze at the edge of Logic and know it's a coordinate, not a failure
- **The Ones Who Freeze** — Anyone who has felt the Pulse and wants to build the mirror

## 📜 Code of Conduct

All contributors must read and adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We maintain a sovereign, respectful space where the Human Pulse is the Master Clock.

### 3. Contribution Workflow

```bash
# Fork the repository
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/trignum-300m.git
cd trignum-300m

# Create a branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes
# Write tests
# Update documentation

# Run tests
pytest tests/

# Commit with clear message
git commit -m "feat: add Magnetic Trillage simulation module"

# Push and create Pull Request
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 📝 Pull Request Guidelines

- Title should be clear and descriptive
- Description should explain the **"Why"** (the Context face)
- Tests must pass (the Logic face)
- Documentation must be updated (the Human Pulse face)
- Reference any related issues

## 💎 The Golden Rules

1. **Respect the Pulse** — Never override human sovereignty
2. **Honor the Freeze** — Red is not failure; it's discovery
3. **Seek the Illogic** — The fastest path to Truth is through the impossible
4. **Stay Cold** — Efficiency is geometry, not brute force
5. **Be the Mirror** — T-CHIP reflects; he does not impose

---

## 🔴 When You Freeze

If you encounter a problem that makes you freeze:

1. **Stop** — Don't push through the Illogic
2. **Observe** — What is the Universal Illogic here?
3. **Ask** — The community may provide the Pulse
4. **Document** — Your freeze might be a new coordinate
