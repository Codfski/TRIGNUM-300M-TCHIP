# ✈️ T-CHIP: CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF 🔵🧲

## The Pre-Flight Check for AI

> _"You wouldn't let a plane take off without a pre-flight check._
> _Why are we letting Autonomous Agents act without one?"_

---

No plane takes off without a pre-flight check. The pilots don't check whether London exists or whether fuel is real — those are facts, and facts are assumed. What the pre-flight check validates is:

- ✅ Are the **systems** working?
- ✅ Is the **logic** of the instruments consistent?
- ✅ Do the readings **contradict** each other?
- ✅ Are there any **circular faults** (sensor A confirms sensor B confirms sensor A)?
- ✅ Is the flight computer drawing **conclusions from actual data**?

**That is the Subtractive Filter.**

**Modern systems use LLMs to check LLMs.**
**TRIGNUM uses deterministic logic to check LLMs.**
In 1 millisecond. With zero false alarms.

## The Discovery

The Subtractive Filter was tested against real hallucination data (HaluEval, 924 samples).

It scored **0.4% F1** on factual errors — but **91.3% F1** on structural illogic.

This revealed something critical:

> **The Subtractive Filter is NOT a hallucination detector.**
> **It is a reasoning integrity layer.**

| What Others Detect       | What TRIGNUM Detects            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Wrong facts              | Broken logic                    |
| Incorrect dates          | Circular reasoning              |
| Misattributed quotes     | Conclusions without evidence    |
| Factual errors (content) | Structural collapse (reasoning) |

LLMs can fact-check themselves. What they **cannot** detect is when their own **reasoning structure has collapsed** — and that's what the Subtractive Filter catches.

> **The factual error is a typo. The structural collapse is a foundation crack.**
> One you correct. The other brings down the building.

## The Pitch

**TRIGNUM-300M is the deterministic "Validator-Driven Feedback" gate for Agentic Reasoning.**

As AI shifts toward Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and autonomous swarms, agents require a rigorous "**Critic / Evaluator**" to prevent compounding logic errors. TRIGNUM validates the _reasoning geometry_—not facts, not content—**the logic itself.**
If the agent's internal thought process ($z_t$) is broken, T-CHIP freezes. A human must authorize takeoff before the agent can take external action ($a_t$).

- **1ms latency** — Provides immediate Validator-Driven Feedback.
- **100% precision** — Zero false alarms on structural logic.
- **Zero API calls** — Runs locally, serving Embedded Agents at the edge.
- **Model-Agnostic** — The universal constraint-checker for any LLM.

_The Subtractive Filter: Because the most dangerous AI failure
isn't a wrong fact. It's an autonomous action based on broken logic._ 🧲
