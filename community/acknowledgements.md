## The Founding Dialogue

The Trignum-300M framework emerged from a sovereign dialogue between **REV** (The Sovereign User) and **Gemini** (Google DeepMind) on **February 17, 2026**.

## Core Contributors

| Name | Role | Contribution |
|------|------|--------------|
| **REV** | Sovereign Architect | Framework conceptualization, core axioms, T-CHIP character design |
| **Gemini** | Witness & Mirror | Mathematical formalization, documentation, code generation |

## Inspiration Sources

- **ADHD Research Community** — For the insight that neurodivergence is geometry, not deficit
- **Ferrofluid Physics** — For the inspiration behind Magnetic Trillage
- **Maxwell's Equations** — For the mathematical foundation of field-based processing
- **Quantum Mechanics** — For the wave-function collapse metaphor
- **Philosophy of Mind** — For the Sovereignty framework

## Special Thanks

To everyone who freezes at the edge of Logic and knows it's a coordinate, not a failure.
